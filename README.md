# Ghiaseddin - قیاس الدین

This repo contains the code for the paper "Deep Relative Attributes" by Yaser Souri, Erfan Noury, Ehsan Adeli Mosabbeb.

## The paper

The paper was originally submitted to CVPR 2016 with the name "Deep Relative Attributes" by Yaser Souri ([@yassersouri](https://github.com/yassersouri)), Erfan Noury ([@erfannoury](https://github.com/erfannoury)), Ehsan Adeli Mosabbeb ([@eadeli](https://github.com/eadeli)).
Later a modified version of the paper was put on arXiv [arxiv:1511.xxxx](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.xxxx).
Who knows what happens next?!

## The name

The name is Ghiaseddin which is written as "قیاس الدین" in Persian/Arabic. It is pronouned as "Ghiyāth ad-Dīn". Ghias or "قیاس" is the Persia/Arabic word that refers to the act of comparing two things (which is what we actually do in relative attributes).
Furthermore Ghiaseddin has a relation to [Ghiyāth al-Dīn Jamshīd al-Kāshī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamsh%C4%ABd_al-K%C4%81sh%C4%AB) "غیاث الدین جمشید کاشانی", where "Ghiaseddin" is pronounced similar to the first name of "Jamshīd al-Kāshī" but written with different letters in Persian/Arabic ("قیاس الدین" vs "غیاث الدین").

## The code

The code is written in Python2.7 and uses the [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) deep learning framework which is based on the amazing [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). These two are the main dependencies of the project for a complete list of dependencies see `requirements.txt`.

## Running the Experiments
